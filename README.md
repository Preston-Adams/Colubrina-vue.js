## Backend setup
First, configure a database and user (MariaDB strongly recommended) for Colubrina.<br>
Please navigate to the `backend` folder and run `yarn`.<br>

Then navigate to the `cli` folder, and run the following commands:

```
yarn
```
to install dependencies, and then
```
node .
```
which should result in an interactive CLI prompt looking like the following:
```
